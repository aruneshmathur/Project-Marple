An empirical study of code reuse in open source projects.
=========================================================

Switched to Python in this branch, primarily to explore the possibility of 
using a database to store data. If this branch works alright, then it'll 
become the master and the other branch will be deprecated, but will 
continue to exist.

Keep looking out for updates, both on this and the master branch!
