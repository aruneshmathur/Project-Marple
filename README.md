An emperical study of code reuse in open source software from sourceforge.
==========================================================================

MOSS is a widely used code similarity detector. We aim to better MOSS' results
by introducing new factors which understand code reuse much better. In the
future, we plan on running this on around 100 projects from Sourceforge and 
understand how Open Source developers reuse code.
